SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.

Principles:

*   S - Single-responsiblity. A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job
*   O - Open-closed. Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
*   L - Liskov Substitution. Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
*   I - Interface Segregation. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
*   D - Dependency Inversion. Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
